## Griot: An open source toolset for telling engaging stories (March 2014)

**The Minneapolis Institute of Arts** (MIA) has created an open source toolset for crafting and sharing engaging stories. The software tools – which create an optimized website - were developed in-house as part of the museum-wide digital experience project (nicknamed TDX). TDX is a cross-functional effort to delight our visitors by delivering interesting and accessible stories based on the museum’s vast collection using digital platforms. The MIA will continue to refine and implement the tools, while at the same time sharing them with the wider community in hopes of finding collaborative partners who will use and expand the functionality going forward.

**The first phase** of the TDX project was launched in November 2013, to coincide with the re-opening of the MIA’s African Art Galleries.  The internal development team delivered the toolset and tablet devices were installed in the galleries for visitors to explore and enjoy. The museum branded the digital delivery as “ArtStories” to help visitors locate and recognize each installation. The initial roll-out has been met with positive response from audiences and the press. The tablets are in use every day, engaging people in social interactions and shared experiences, as well as allowing individuals to dive deeply into the content on their own.

**The development team** has dubbed the software toolset *Griot* (a West African term that describes a wise story-teller). The application provides user friendly methods for crafting stories, and incorporating multimedia content (e.g., images, audio, and video). The stories are presented online or in-gallery via an internet browser. The *Griot* package includes three specific tools for (1) authoring content, (2) presenting stories, and (3) tiling & annotating large images to enhance zooming, panning and to highlight particular details. The tools can be used to produce mobile device-ready experiences and/or to develop websites.  Because the software is open source, it is available for free and can be used by many different types of organizations. In addition, open source enables any skilled developer to modify the software and to contribute those modifications to the project, enhancing *Griot* for all who use it.

**Future plans** for *Griot* include increased optimization for small-screen devices (e.g., smart phones), a broader implementation across the full array of galleries at the MIA, and (of course) adding many more stories to delight the public. In addition to the MIA-based work, an important future goal is to establish a collaborative network of partners who will make use of and extend the toolset for the benefit of all. The *Griot* tools might be implemented at a science museum as “ScienceInsights” or at a history center as “HistoryHighlights”. The potential uses of the software toolset (and nicknames) are bound only by the vision of those who adopt and extend it.
